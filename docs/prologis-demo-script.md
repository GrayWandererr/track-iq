# Prologis Innovation Platform Demo Script

## Introduction (1 minute)

**"Good [morning/afternoon], and thank you for joining us today.**

For years, Fulfillment IQ has been the trusted partner for warehouse operators, delivering powerful dashboards, comprehensive reports, AI-driven insights, and seamless integrations. 

Today, we're excited to show you what we've built in partnership with Prologis - a revolutionary AI infrastructure that's setting a new standard for intelligent warehouse operations.

What makes this platform truly groundbreaking is our **semantic layer** - think of it as the universal translator for your warehouse. It seamlessly connects:
- Structured data from your WMS, ERP, and sensors
- Unstructured data from cameras, documents, and communications
- All while maintaining enterprise-grade security and data sovereignty

Let me show you how this transforms daily operations..."

## Dashboard Overview (30 seconds)

**"Let's start with our real-time operational dashboards."**

*[Navigate to Site Dashboard]*

"Here you see our PowerBI-integrated dashboards showing:
- Real-time throughput metrics
- Labor utilization heat maps
- Safety compliance scoring
- Predictive analytics for the next 24 hours

But dashboards are just the beginning. The real magic happens when we bring in AI agents..."

## Agent Studio Introduction (30 seconds)

**"Welcome to the Agent Studio - your AI-powered command center."**

*[Click on Agent Studio in sidebar]*

"Think of this as having a team of expert consultants available 24/7:
- Each agent has deep domain expertise
- They work independently or collaborate on complex problems
- They learn from your operations and get smarter over time

Let me show you how they work..."

## Demo Scenario 1: Safety Compliance (2 minutes)

**"Let's start with a real scenario that happened last week at one of our facilities."**

*[Type in Master Chat: "Show me all PPE violations in the last hour"]*

"Watch how the AI processes this request..."

*[Loading animation shows:]*
- Scanning camera feeds...
- Analyzing safety compliance data...
- Identifying violation patterns...
- Preparing safety report...

"In under 4 seconds, we've analyzed feeds from 128 cameras. Here's what we found:
- 3 violations identified with exact locations and timestamps
- Notice how it prioritizes by severity - the crane operation violation is critical

Now watch this - I can take immediate action:"

*[Click "Send Alert" button]*

"That just notified the zone supervisor's mobile device with the exact location and a snapshot from the camera. The worker will be approached within 2 minutes."

## Demo Scenario 2: Labor Optimization (2 minutes)

**"Now let's tackle a more complex challenge - staffing optimization."**

*[Type: "Is the evening shift adequately staffed?"]*

"The system is now:
- Accessing our workforce management system
- Analyzing current staffing levels
- Calculating optimal distribution
- Generating recommendations

Look at these insights:
- We're 5 workers short for projected volume
- The shortage is concentrated in Zones B and D
- Without intervention, we'll see a 35-minute delay in outbound

But here's where it gets powerful:"

*[Click "Call Additional Staff" button]*

"The system just auto-dialed qualified workers from our standby pool, starting with those who:
- Live closest to the facility
- Have the required certifications
- Haven't exceeded overtime limits

We typically get 3-4 confirmations within 10 minutes."

## Demo Scenario 3: Cross-Functional Intelligence (2 minutes)

**"Now let me show you something that typically takes analysts hours to produce."**

*[Type: "If tomorrow's inbound volume jumps 25%, where will we break first?"]*

"This question requires coordination across multiple systems. Watch as our agents work together..."

*[Show loading steps and response]*

"In seconds, we've modeled the entire operation and identified:
1. Receiving docks hit capacity in 2.5 hours
2. Labor shortage manifests in 3 hours
3. Staging area congestion at 4 hours
4. Equipment shortage at 5 hours

And it's already thought through the safety implications - dock congestion increases injury risk by 3.2x."

*[Click "Create Surge Plan" button]*

"This generates a detailed action plan with:
- Specific staff reassignments
- Equipment rental contacts
- Modified safety protocols
- Communication templates

What used to take a planning meeting and hours of analysis now happens in seconds."

## Demo Scenario 4: Executive Intelligence (1.5 minutes)

**"Let's switch gears to executive reporting."**

*[Type: "Prepare an investor slide showing AI savings from last quarter"]*

"Perfect for board meetings or investor calls. The system is:
- Aggregating financial data across all AI implementations
- Calculating ROI metrics
- Formatting for executive presentation

Look at these results:
- $3.2M in savings - 14% above target
- 287% ROI on AI investment
- 4.2 month payback period

And it breaks down exactly where the savings came from - labor optimization, dock efficiency, safety prevention, and inventory accuracy."

*[Click "Download PPTX" button]*

"One click gives you a professionally formatted slide deck with animations and speaker notes."

## Integration Showcase (1 minute)

**"None of this would be possible without our comprehensive integration platform."**

*[Navigate to Connectors page]*

"We connect to everything in your ecosystem:
- **Real-time data**: Manhattan WMS, camera feeds, IoT sensors
- **Analytics**: PowerBI, Snowflake for your data warehouse
- **Communication**: Slack, Teams, email for alerts
- **Business systems**: Salesforce, HubSpot for customer data

And if you need something we don't have..."

*[Click "Request More" button]*

"We can typically add new connectors within 2-3 weeks."

## Security & Compliance (30 seconds)

**"I know security is paramount for Prologis facilities."**

"Every piece of data:
- Stays within your private cloud instance
- Is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Has role-based access controls
- Maintains complete audit trails

We're SOC 2 Type II certified and comply with all major warehouse regulations."

## ROI Summary (30 seconds)

**"Let me leave you with the bottom line impact."**

"Across our implementations, we're seeing:
- 15-20% reduction in labor costs
- 30% improvement in dock efficiency  
- 67% reduction in safety incidents
- 6-month average payback period

But the real value? Your team spends time solving problems, not finding them."

## Closing & Next Steps (30 seconds)

**"This is just a glimpse of what's possible with the Prologis Innovation Platform.**

In our pilot phase, we're selecting 10 facilities for full implementation. Each gets:
- Dedicated success team
- Custom AI agent training
- 24/7 support

### Common Questions to Prepare For

**Q: "How long does implementation take?"**
A: "Typical deployment is 6-8 weeks. Week 1-2 for integration, 3-4 for AI training, 5-6 for user training, then go-live with support."

**Q: "What if our data is messy?"**
A: "Our semantic layer handles that. We've built adapters for every major WMS and can work with inconsistent data formats."

**Q: "Can we customize the agents?"**
A: "Absolutely. Each agent learns from your specific operations and can be configured with your business rules and priorities."

**Q: "What about change management?"**
A: "We provide comprehensive training and the interface is designed to feel familiar to anyone who uses chat or messaging apps. Most users are productive within hours, not weeks."

**Q: "How do you handle privacy/GDPR?"**
A: "All personal data is anonymized in the AI layer. We can configure retention policies and provide right-to-be-forgotten capabilities as needed."
